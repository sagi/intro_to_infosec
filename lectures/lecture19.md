# 31/03/2018 - 19th Lecture

## Revisted Past Material

We talked about Subnetting, LAN, NAT, IP, 7 Layer model of OSI, DOD Model,
TCP/IP Model, DNS, DHCP, ARP, Binary, Hexadecimal, AND logic operation.

We talked about Bash and recalled many CLI commands such as `rm`, `cd`, `chmod` etc.

## MiTM, SSLStrip and HSTS

We talked about LAN Man-in-the-Middle with ARP. We also talked about
how an attacker can use `SSLStrip` to out-maneuver sites that use https,
if the user initiated an HTTP(not S) request to a site that isn't using
`HSTS` (HTTP Strict Transport Security).

## Windows

- We used CLI commands such as: ping, tracert, telnet, tasklist, ipconfig, arp -a, nslookup.
- We used `regedit` to alter some operation system behaviour.
- We used Mark Rusinovich's `Procmon` and `Process Explorer`.
